Maximizes reactant conversion in a plug-flow tubular reactor for an irreversible, exothermic first-order chemical reaction. More details regarding the optimization problem can be found [here](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/frontdoor/index/index/year/2020/docId/14432).

The optimal control problem is solved via a single-shooting approach with a fourth order Runge-Kutta method for the ODE simulation.
